# Running Pace Calculator

This repository includes the code I used to build my very first web application, which is a running pace calculator. 

Personally, I do not love any of the ones that are available online, so I built my own using Flask, Python, and published it online using google cloud. 

If you have any questions or comments about my code, I would love feedback!
