# Running Pace Calculator

This repository includes the code I used to build my very first web application, which is a running pace calculator. 

Personally, I do not love any of the ones that are available online, so I built my own using Flask, Python, and published it online using google cloud. 

If you have any questions or comments about my code, I would love feedback!

Here is the link to the pace calculator: https://my-first-web-app-319405.uc.r.appspot.com/ 

Note: The link is currently broken since I do not have the ability to maintain the server on my current computer. Application will be up again within the next few months once I get my new computer.
