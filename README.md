# Running Pace Calculator

This repository includes the code I used to build my very first web application, which is a running pace calculator. 

Personally, I do not love any of the ones that are available online, so I built my own using Flask and Python

I published it online using the google cloud sdk. 

If you have any questions or comments about my code, I would love feedback!

Also, a fair warning that the repl backend is free so it'll take a bit to boot the app. Thanks for your patience!
